Q1: 
testBST.o	BSTInt.o	BSTNodeInt.o	bst

Q2: 
Result:
g++      -g -Wall -std=c++11 -c BSTInt.cpp
BSTInt.cpp: In function 'bool insert(int)':
BSTInt.cpp:25:8: error: 'root' was not declared in this scope
   if (!root) {
        ^
BSTInt.cpp:27:7: error: 'isize' was not declared in this scope

make: *** [BSTInt.o] Error 1

The compiler cannot find the declaration of those variables, because the
removed part was the name of the class, which contains the above variables,
removing the namespace makes the compiler not knows where to find the
variables.

Q3: 
The insert function does not return false if an item already existed in the
tree.

Q4:
First, I looked at the description comment for each function and find out what
is the purpose of these functions.
Then, I looked at the tester cases and see if all cases are being tested, which
I found that the tester does not test two cases: insert existed item for insert
function and find not existed item for find function.
After adding those two cases in tester, I compile and run the tester again and
the result shows the code has a bug in insert function, which does not return
false if an item already existed in the tree.
